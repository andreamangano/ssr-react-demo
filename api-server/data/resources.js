 abstract: "Since we started to see JS on the server side, the dream of developers has been to reduce the gap and the cost of switch between frontend/backend. Today with Node.js, React and a whole ecosystem of tools, this dream is becoming true! In this talk, I am going to discuss Universal (a.k.a. Isomorphic) JS and present some practical example regarding the major patterns related to routing, data retrieval, and rendering. I will use Node, React, Webpack, Babel and React Router and give you a series of example to get you started easily with this new technology trend."
