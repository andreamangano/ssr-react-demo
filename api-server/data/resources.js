    abstract: "Let's have a closer look at the feature that allows you to build universal applications with React Server-Side Rendering  —  SSR from here on  —  is the ability of a front-end framework to render markup while running on a back-end system. Applications that have the ability to render both on the server and on the client are called universal apps. In order to understand why SSR is needed, we need to understand the evolution of web applications in the past 10 years.",

    abstract: "Since we started to see JS on the server side, the dream of developers has been to reduce the gap and the cost of switch between frontend/backend. Today with Node.js, React and a whole ecosystem of tools, this dream is becoming true! In this talk, I am going to discuss Universal (a.k.a. Isomorphic) JS and present some practical example regarding the major patterns related to routing, data retrieval, and rendering. I will use Node, React, Webpack, Babel and React Router and give you a series of example to get you started easily with this new technology trend.",
